## Zhikai Huang 黄志凯

I am an incoming PhD student at Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), after receiving my M.Sc. in biomedical engineering in the same university. Prior that, I obtained my B.Eng. in microelectronics from [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am doing research in cutting-edge biomedical sensors (device, process, fabrication) as well as related interface circuits. I strive to make innovations that can improve the walfare of human and society.
