## Zhikai Huang 黄志凯

I was born in [XianYang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianyang), one of the most ancient cities in China. I obtained my M.Sc. in biomedical engineering and B.Eng. in microelectronics from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and [Xi’an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), respectively. I am a researcher working in cutting-edge sensor technology (device, process, fabrication) as well as interface circuits. I strive to make innovations that can improve the walfare of human and society.
